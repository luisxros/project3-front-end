## Getting started

[Click here](https://project-trending.netlify.app/) to see the deployed app!


## Explanation
 - used React.js to make a SPA. in order to make the app more response without refresing. used components to structure and style the entire page. 

 - used Express.js, mongoDB and mongoose to set up my database. users are able to register and save their information in the DB. passwords are encrypted and Salted.



## Approach
-I use the trello board to design the approach a user would take once inside the app. I was able to design it with a wireframe. With those two ready I was able to move forward with my React.js and Express.js to input my functionalities. following the wireframe design i was able to stylized my page according to how i planned.


## Future Enhancements
